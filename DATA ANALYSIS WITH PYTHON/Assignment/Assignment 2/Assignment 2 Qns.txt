Case:

Given dataset consists of a sample of sales made at a retail store during 2011. It has 6 columns:

1. InvoiceDate: The timestamp at which the bill is generated
2. InvoiceNo: Serial number of the invoice generated (May or may not be unique in the sample)
3. Quantity: Quantity of the product purchased
4. CustomerID: Serial number of the customer in the database
5. Unitprice: Price of one unit
6. Stockcode: Product identification number (Lays/Milk Packets)


Questions:

1. Calculate

	(a) How many unique dates are present in the dataset (Nov 1st is different from Oct 1st) Numerical
	(b) How many different months are present in the dataset Numerical
	
2. Calculate the total revenue generated for each day in the dataset Dictionary Output
    HINT: Revenue = Quantity * Unitprice
	
3. Calculate average revenue generated per invoice for each day. HINT: (total revenue per day / #unique invoice numbers) Dictionary output

4. Highest and least quantity for each month is to be calculated (List/Dict)

5. Maximum and minimum counts of invoices per day in a month for all months and also respective dates are to be captured
Ex: Oct month max unique invoice count is on 25th OCT and the count is 10, min invoice count is on 4th OCT and the count is 2

6. Maximum and minimum counts of customers per day in a month for all months and also respective dates are to be captured
Ex: Oct month max  unique customer count is on 25th OCT, min invoice count is on 4th OCT
